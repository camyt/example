# WEF
Contains R scripts for wind energy forecaster (WEF), built for Climate Central. The purpose is to predict how much wind energy will be produced in each state over the next three-day period.

# Code Example

# Motivation
The goal is to inform policymakers and the general public about how much energy wind farms in the US currently supply, how variable the wind energy source is, and give a general indication of which regions are best-suited to wind turbine development.

# Installation
